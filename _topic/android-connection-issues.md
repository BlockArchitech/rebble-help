# Android Pairing Issues

On some newer version of android, you may find that when trying to pair your watch to your phone, you cannot find it. Some users report that they can see the watch in Android BT settings, but not the Pebble app. To fix this, please follow the steps provided.

# Forget BT if required

If you have already connected to the watch directly in your Phone's bluetooth settings, forget it before continuing.

# Restart your phone

Now restart your phone (Sometimes this is all you need!)

# Ensure Location is enabled

Check that your phone has location enabled, and check that the Pebble app has the location permission.
This is required for an app to scan for bluetooth devices.

# Airplane Hack

Put your phone into airplane mode. Once it's enabled, re-enable bluetooth only. Now open the Pebble app and attempt the pairing process. If you are trying to pair a Pebble 2, this can take many attempts.

At this point you should be successful in pairing your watch to your phone. If you are still having issues, drop by #rebble-help on our [Discord server](https://rebble.io/discord)
