# The boot process

The boot process, or 'running boot', is the process in which you tell the Pebble app to use Rebble servers.   

You perform this process during inital Rebble setup, but it can sometimes be useful to re-run it as a problem solving step.

Press next to start the guide

# Visit boot.rebble.io

On your phone, visit [boot.rebble.io](https://boot.rebble.io)

If you are not already logged in, you will be prompted to log in:

**Make sure you log in with the correct account**   

# Switch to Rebble

Read the page, then tap the switch to Rebble button.   

The browser will then ask if you want to open it with Pebble.

Press 'Switch To Rebble'

# All Done

You should then see this page:

Press "It's Rebble Time" and you're done!

**If you get back to the Pebble app and don't see the rocket screen, go back to the browser and press *switch to Rebble* again.**

You have now re-run the boot process. This forces a timeline sync and relinks you to Rebble.
