# The boot process

The boot process, or 'running boot', is the process in which you tell the Pebble app to use Rebble servers.   

You perform this process during inital Rebble setup, but it can sometimes be useful to re-run it as a problem solving step.

Press next to start the guide

# Visit boot.rebble.io

On your phone, visit [boot.rebble.io](https://boot.rebble.io)

# Press 'Switch to Rebble'

Read the page, then tap the switch to Rebble button. If you get a prompt, press 'Okay'.

The Pebble iOS app will then open. If you get the 'Configuration change' prompt, press 'Change'.

Press "It's Rebble Time"

You have now re-run the boot process. This forces a timeline sync and relinks you to Rebble.
