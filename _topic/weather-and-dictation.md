# Getting Dictation and weather pins 

![](/images/misc/voice.png)

Rebble offers a free tier which includes the appstore, timeline (with a 3 hours sync period), and everything else to get the basics up and running.   
    
Dictation (Voice replies) and weather for the built-in weather app require a rebble subscription, which costs $3/month.
