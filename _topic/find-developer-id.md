# Find an author's developer ID

To find the developer ID of an app on the appstore, first open the appstore at [apps.rebble.io](https://apps.rebble.io/) in a browser.

Once open, search for an application by the author of which you want to find the developer ID.

# View the URL

If you look at the URL of the page you are now on, the developer ID is the alphanumeric ID that forms the second to last part of the URL.

If there is a question mark in the URL, ignore it and everything after it.

You have now attained the developer ID for that developer.
