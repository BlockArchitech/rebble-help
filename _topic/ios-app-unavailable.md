# iOS app removal 

On the 4th of October 2021 the Pebble app was removed from the iOS App Store. That means new users who do not already have the Pebble app installed on their iPhones will not be able to download it from the Apple Appstore.

Users who already have the app installed should be fine so long as they do not uninstall it.

While Rebble are working on a replacement app, it is not yet ready for use. If you are an iOS developer, [get in touch!](https://rebble.io/contact)

There are a few workaround options for install the app. The simplest is detailed in [this help topic](/sideload-ios-app). For more options or further questions, [join us on Discord](https://rebble.io/discord).
