# iOS app removal 

On the 4th of October 2021 the Pebble app was removed from the iOS App Store. That means new users who do not already have the Pebble app installed on their iPhones will not be able to download it.

Users who already have the app installed should be fine so long as they do not uninstall it.

While Rebble are working on a replacement app, it is not yet ready for use. If you are an iOS developer, [get in touch!](https://rebble.io/contact)

Unfortunately at this time there is no workaround we can suggest for new iOS users who don't have the app. For further questions, [join us on Discord](https://rebble.io/discord).
