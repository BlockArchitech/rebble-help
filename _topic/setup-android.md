# Android app removal 

The Pebble app was removed from the Google Play Store due to SMS issues ([Read about it here.](/android-app-unavailable))

If you do not have the Pebble app installed, don't worry, keep following the guide! 

If you already have the Pebble app installed but not set up, skip to [Step #4](https://help.rebble.io/setup-android/#4).


# Connect your Pebble to its charger

Connect your Pebble to a plugged in USB charging cable. You really wouldn't want it to lose power in the middle of a firmware update! Once the watch is powered on, press the left button to dismiss the charging screen.


# Download the Pebble APK

On your Android device, download the Pebble APK from the following link:

[APK Download](https://rebble.io/apk)

<notmobile>
or via this QR code:   
   
   <qr url="https://rebble.io/apk" />
</notmobile>
   

# Install the APK

Once you've downloaded the .apk file, open it on your phone by selecting it, then selecting **Install**:

You might be prompted with the following screen:

![](/images/setup/1.png)


If so, click through to Settings and select "Allow from this source" to enable installation of apps from unknown sources for your preferred file manager.

This will allow the official Pebble app to be sideloaded. You can revert this setting when the Pebble app is installed if you'd like!


**On earlier versions of Android (7 or below), the permissions step will be slightly different**. 

If you're running Android 7 or below:

- Once you've downloaded the .apk file, open Settings.
- Tap "Lock screen and Security," or "Security."
- Tap "Allow installation from unknown sources," "Unknown sources," or a similar option. Then, read the prompt and tap **OK**.
- Go back to the downloaded Pebble APK file in your file manager, and proceed with the installation.


# Open the Pebble app

You’ll be greeted by the Pebble Account page. Simply tap 'SKIP LOGIN' twice to continue.

# Choose the type of Pebble you have

# Pair your watch

The app starts looking for nearby Pebbles. It should shortly see your Pebble, as "Pebble xxxx". This same name can be seen on the Pebble, so you know the phone sees the right watch. Tap it.   

*If the Pebble doesn’t appear and you are on Android 10 (or newer), make sure that Location is turned on; as that is how the Pebble app searches for nearby Bluetooth devices.  If that still doesn't work, go to the Bluetooth settings page of the phone, pair the watch, and try again.*

If your phone does not see the Pebble, try these steps:
1. Turn on Airplane mode on your phone
2. Turn on Location (this is how Pebble looks for nearby Bluetooth devices)
3. Turn on Bluetooth
4. Pair the Pebble through the Pebble app. (Make sure to turn off Airplane Mode afterwards!)

If that still doesn't work, please [contact us on Discord](/discord)

# Run through the watch setup

Run through the Pebble setup screens. Make sure you allow notification access:

# Complete the Pebble pairing

Once you get to this screen, you've successfully connected your Pebble! 

All that's left to do now is to connect it to Rebble Web Services.

# Visit boot.rebble.io

The boot process, or 'running boot', is the process in which you tell the Pebble app to use Rebble servers instead of the defunct Pebble servers.   

On your phone, open a decent browser (like Chrome or Firefox), and go to [boot.rebble.io](https://boot.rebble.io)

<notmobile>
    <qr url="https://boot.rebble.io" />
</notmobile>

If you are not already logged in, you will be greeted with a number of ways to sign in.   

Choose one and sign in. *Remember your sign in credentials!*

If this is successful, you will return to the Rebble website, and be greeted with *You're all set!*

# Press 'Switch to Rebble'

Read the page, then tap the switch to Rebble button. 

If you get a prompt about "Open with Pebble", press 'Okay'.

Press 'Switch To Rebble'.

The Pebble app will then open.

# All done!

Press "It's Rebble Time" and you're done!

**If you get back to the Pebble app and don't see the rocket screen, go back to the browser and press *switch to Rebble* again.**

# What's next?

You’re done! Tap the big “+” in the lower right corner to find and install watchfaces you like from the Rebble appstore.
