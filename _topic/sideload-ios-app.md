# Installing the Pebble app on iOS with Sideloadly

>## [Looking for download links? Go to the end of the guide]!

---
The Pebble app is [no longer on the App Store](/ios-app-unavailable).   
No worries! If you have an Apple ID, you can install the app yourself! Just be aware that you have to do this every week for the app to keep working!

If you install the app and don't redo the process after a week, your Pebble will still receive notifications.

## Help:
- If you have sideloading issues, try installing the latest iTunes and iCloud before starting the process.
    > For Windows users: **DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MICROSOFT STORE VERSION**. Download and install from Apple's website.
- If the app does not start, go to the Settings app > General > Device Management > (your Apple ID email). The Pebble app should now have a "Verified" status. If not, repeat steps 3-6.
- If Sideloadly does not work for you, try using **AltStore***.
