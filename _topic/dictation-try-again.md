# Dictation doesn't work

If, when using dictation, you get the error 'Error occurred. Try again.', try the following:

- Open the Pebble app on your phone, and go to Settings.

- Tap Voice Language.

- Change it to any other language.

- Then, change it back to your preferred language.

- Retry dictation.
