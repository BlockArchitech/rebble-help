# Rebble Subscription   

So, you started using the Rebble Web Services, but want to add the paid plan for Weather and Dictation services. There are a few things to consider, before you order it:

- On iOS, replying to text messages isn’t possible. This is a limitation from iOS. So, dictation will NOT add spoken replies to text messages.

- Weather services is solely for the native Pebble weather app and for weather info in timeline. Watchfaces and 3rd party apps that offer weather info, have their own means to fetch weather info. You don’t need the Rebble paid plan for them.

- Payment is handled by Stripe, which only offers payment by credit card.

- You can pay monthly and cancel anytime, or pay yearly and get one month free.

- Your money will help the Rebble Alliance to keep all Rebble Web Services (including the free ones) running.

What you *do* get is:

- Dictation support for apps, and replying to messages (including SMS on Android)

- A faster (30 minute) timeline sync period

- A warm fuzzy feeling for supporting the project
