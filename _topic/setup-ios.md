# Connect your Pebble to its charger   

Connect your Pebble to the plugged in USB charging cable. You really don’t want it to lose power in the middle of a firmware update! The watch powers up. Press the left button to dismiss the charging screen.

# Install the app from the appstore

On your iPhone, download the Pebble app from the appstore:

[Appstore Link](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/pebble/id957997620?mt=8)

<notmobile>

or via this QR code:   

<qr url="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/pebble/id957997620?mt=8" />

</notmobile>
   
# Open the Pebble app

You’ll be greeted by a Pebble Account page. Simply tap the Skip in the top left corner to continue.

# Choose the type of Pebble you have

iOS then asks for permission to use Bluetooth, tap OK

# Pair your watch

The app starts looking for nearby Pebbles. It should shortly see your Pebble, as Pebble xxxx. This same string can be seen on the Pebble, so you know the phone sees the right watch. Tap it.   

If the Pebble doesn’t appear and you’re on Android 10, go to the bluetooth settings page of the phone, pair the watch, and try again. (If that doesn’t help, unpair it there again.)

# Run through the watch setup

Run through the Pebble setup screens. Make sure you allow notification access:

# Finish configuring your Pebble

Once you get to this screen, you've finished part 1 - connecting your Pebble.

All that's left to do now is connect it to Rebble Web Services.

# Open auth.rebble.io

On the phone, open a decent browser (like Chrome), and go to auth.rebble.io.

<notmobile>
    <qr url="https://auth.rebble.io" />
</notmobile>

You are greeted with a number of ways to sign in.

Choose one and sign in. *Remember your sign in credentials!*

You will return to the Rebble site, and are greeted with *You’re all set!*   


# Switch to Rebble 

Read the page, then tap the switch to Rebble button.   
The browser will then ask if you want to open it with Pebble.

You should then see this page:

If you get back to the Pebble app and don't see that screen, go back to the browser and press *switch to Rebble* again.

# You’re done!

You’re done! Go to Watchfaces, tap the big red “+” in the lower right corner and find and install watchfaces you like from the Rebble store.
