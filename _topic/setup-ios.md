# iOS app removal 

On the 4th of October 2021 the Pebble app was removed from the iOS App Store. 

That means new users who do not already have the Pebble app installed on their iPhones will not be able to download it.

While Rebble are working on a replacement app, it is not yet ready for use. If you are an iOS developer, [get in touch!](https://rebble.io/contact)

If you do not have the Pebble app installed, follow this [sideloading (installation) guide](/sideload-ios-app) first! 

If you already have the Pebble app installed but not set up, continue with the guide.


# Connect your Pebble to its charger

Connect your Pebble to a plugged in USB charging cable. You really wouldn't want it to lose power in the middle of a firmware update! Once the watch is powered on, press the left button to dismiss the charging screen.


# Open the Pebble app

If prompted, allow the Pebble app to turn on Bluetooth.

# Skip the sign in page

The old sign in page (now blank) will be shown.

Press SKIP in the top left.


# Choose dictation language

Choose your dictation language.    

![](/images/ios/setup3.png)

To use dictation you will need a [Rebble subscription.](/subscription)


# Choose the type of Pebble you have

![](/images/ios/setup4.png)

iOS then opens the accessory pairing screen. Wait a moment, then select your Pebble.

# Wait for any updates

If required, your watch will now update. Wait for this to complete, then go to the next step.

# Select the Pebble language

Choose your language.

# Allow LE pairing

Allow the Pebble app to pair with your watch in Low Energy (LE) mode.

# Enable push notifications

Allow notifications.

# Allow location access

Press 'Allow Once'. You will need to change this to 'Always' later for certain Pebble functionality to work, such as local weather.

# Setup calendars and Pebble Health

Run through the Calendar and Pebble Health screens. Enabling these is optional, but recommended.

# Finish configuring your Pebble

Once you get to this screen, you've successfully connected your Pebble! 

All that's left to do now is to configure the location permission and connect it to Rebble Web Services.

![](/images/ios/setup16.png)   


# Allow location

Open your iPhone's settings and look for "Privacy." Then, open the "Location Services" section.

A list of your apps should load. Find the Pebble app here.

Set the location permission to 'Always'. This is required for things like watchface weather.

# Visit boot.rebble.io

The boot process, or 'running boot', is the process in which you tell the Pebble app to use Rebble servers instead of the defunct Pebble servers.   

On your phone, open a decent browser (like Chrome or Firefox), and go to [boot.rebble.io](https://boot.rebble.io)

<notmobile>
    <qr url="https://boot.rebble.io" />
</notmobile>

If you are not already logged in, you will be greeted with a number of ways to sign in.   

Choose one and sign in. *Remember your sign in credentials!*

If this is successful, you will return to the Rebble website, and be greeted with *You're all set!*

# Press 'Switch to Rebble'

Read the page, then tap the switch to Rebble button. 

If you get a prompt about "Open with Pebble", press 'Okay'.

Press 'Switch To Rebble'.

The Pebble iOS app will then open. If you get the 'Configuration change' prompt, press 'Change'.

**Wait at least fifteen seconds** before proceeding to the next step!

# Tap the exclamation mark

After waiting, tap the yellow exclamation mark in the top left of the screen ![icon](/images/ios/boot4.png)

Press Log in. 

![](/images/ios/boot2.png)


# All done!

Press "It's Rebble Time" and you're done!

**If you get back to the Pebble app and don't see the rocket screen, go back to the browser and press *switch to Rebble* again.**

You have now re-run the boot process. This forces a timeline sync and relinks you to Rebble.

# What's next?

You’re done! Tap the big “+” in the lower right corner to find and install watchfaces you like from the Rebble appstore.

If you want to use dictation, get weather pins in your Timeline, and have a faster Timeline sync period, check out a [Rebble subscription](/subscription)
